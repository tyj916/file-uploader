Things learned and practiced in this project:
- Object-relational Mapping (ORM)
- Content type file handling with multer
- Integrate with cloud storage Cloudinary
- User authentication with passportjs
- Form validation with express validator
- etc...

There are a lot more features to be added, and many bugs to be fixed. I can't think any of them right now but I should write them down when building my next project...
